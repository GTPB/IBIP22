## From quantitatives to biological insights

### What we need to know about biological pathways and networks?

In this session, we will talk about different types of biological networks, and specifically the STRING database of functional protein associations. We will learn how we can use such databases to find out more about a list of genes or proteins, identified to behave differentially in a given experiment. The slides are [here](/20220622_STRING_and_Cytoscape_for_proteomics_data_analysis.pdf).  

You can go to the STRING exercises [here](https://jensenlab.org/training/string/eubic/). 

### How can we interpret proteomics data with STRING and Cytoscape?

In this session, we will focus more on the standalone tool for network visualization and analysis Cytoscape. We will try out different network visualization and analysis methods on a publicly available dataset. 

The stringApp exercises are [here](https://jensenlab.org/training/stringapp/eubic/) and the Omics Visualizer ones are [here](https://jensenlab.org/training/omicsvisualizer/). 

### What can you find out about your own dataset using Cytoscape? 

Finally, in this session, you can try to replicate some of the previous steps on your own data or one of the datasets covered previously in the course.
